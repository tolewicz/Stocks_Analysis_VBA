# Challenge

* code: green_stocks_TO

*Code description
The code loops over all rows and checks if the value in A column corresponds to the ticker - outer loop
If the value corresponds to the ticker, the inner loop calcualtes total volume, starting and ending price
Once the ticker does no match value in cell of column A, the outer loop is executed that changes the ticker
I refined the code by removing extra loop from formating results
I added starting and ending price
